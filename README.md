The app can be tested on https://ng-course-recipe-book-1db1a.web.app/auth

You can create a dummy user and test the app

The project is made by following a complete Angular course.

I will make at some point more improvements :)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.5.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
